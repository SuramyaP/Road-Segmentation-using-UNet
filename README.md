# Road Segmentation using UNet

The [Road_Segmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/SuramyaP/Road-Segmentation-using-UNet/blob/main/Road_Segmentation.ipynb) notebook contains the dataset preprocessing, model training and evaluation.

Run all the cells consecutively. Make sure to upload your Kaggle API token on the third code cell to proceed. The training and processing has occured in Google Colab using the available T4 GPU. All the paths may be in the google colab format, so make sure to edit them accordingly.
All other details are explained in the notebook itself.

Likewise, if you simply want to inference the model, make sure to first download the checkpoint file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OTjs99sSI1YZn0Qx89Da19FyUBac_5xT?usp=sharing). Then, run the [Inferencing.ipynb](https://github.com/SuramyaP/Road-Segmentation-using-UNet/blob/main/Inferencing.ipynb) notebook. The inferencing currently has been done using the three test images in the [Inf Images](https://github.com/SuramyaP/Road-Segmentation-using-UNet/tree/main/Inf%20Images) folder.
